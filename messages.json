Let's implement this design using React and Tailwind CSS, which are already set up in our project.\n\nHere's what we'll do:\n1. Update the Index page to match the design in the image.\n2. Use appropriate fonts and colors to replicate the look.\n3. Center the content on the page.\n\nLet's start by updating the necessary files:\n\n\n\nNow, let's update the Index.tsx file to create the desired layout:\n\n\n\nFinally, let's update the global CSS file to ensure we have a clean slate:\n\n\n\nThese changes should create a page that closely resembles the one in the image.\n</HST-code>\n\nThe page now displays \"Hello World!\" in large, bold, blue text, centered on the screen, with a smaller green text below it saying \"Welcome to my first web page!\"."
